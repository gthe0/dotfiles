# MY DOTFILES
While I myself use a modified version of these dotfiles, I still encourage you to explore and adapt them to your likings.

**DISCLAIMER**:These are my personal dotfiles for various text/code editors. You're welcome to copy any parts of them, however do not blindly use my settings unless you know what they do. Proceed at your own risk!
