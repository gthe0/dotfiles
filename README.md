# MY DOTFILES
While I myself use a modified version of these dotfiles, I still encourage you to explore and adapt them to your likings.

**DISCLAIMER**:These are my personal dotfiles for various text/code, shells and other tools tha I use or have used in the past. You're welcome to copy any parts of them, however do not blindly use my settings unless you know what they do. Proceed at your own risk!
